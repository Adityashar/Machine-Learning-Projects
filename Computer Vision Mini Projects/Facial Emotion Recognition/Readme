FACIAL EMOTION RECOGNITION

In this Mini Project, we're determining our real-time facial expressions using a pre-trained model to predict the emotions.

For this Mini-Project, we require the knowledge of:

1. OpenCV and Keras Deep Learning Framework
2. Convolutional Neural Networks
3. Basic Python Libraries
